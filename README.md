1. SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE - Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality.

2. OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPLE - Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification. In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.

3. LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE - Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

4. INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE - Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they canâ€™t do. Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

5. DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE - Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
